Here you can find all small scripts I have once written to perform simple (behavioral) data analysis

Most scripts are independently and widely usable, if the section *MODIFYME* is correctly adjusted to your own needs.

I have tried to comment as much as possible at all steps in the scripts.
If something is not clear, or simply does not work, you can e-mail me at sjoerds.zs@gmail.com

If something does work, and you get some nice data / results; also let me know! I would love to hear, and rejoice with you :)

Have fun!
