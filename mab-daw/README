A series of scripts to analyse behavioral data from the multi (4) arm bandit ('mab') task by Daw et al., 2006. 
Scripts include steps for data prep, raw data analysis, and modeling (e.g. Q-learning).

Overall structure is the same: edit the %%MODIFYME%% field to customize, then the rest should be able to run independently.

In great collaboration with Marieke Jepma, Leiden University.
